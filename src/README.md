# Overview

For this project I used the swing library in Java and I wanted to get more familiar with GUIs.

I wrote this banking app to show the user the amount of money in their account and the ability to withdraw and deposit money in their account.

This was my first project in Java, I wanted to get a feel for the language better and I also wanted to learn more about the swing library.

Java was used with the swing library.

# Future Work

* I would improve certain inputs that the user can use, such as if the user enters a string, there should be an exception thrown.
* I would like to add a block of code that prevents the user from entering a negative number.
* I would like to make the GUI look a little more inviting (more color).
